# Supervised Learning and Data Analysis Workshop

This repository contains my practical assignments for the **"Apprentissage et Analyse de Donn√©es" (Learning and Data Analysis)** course, completed during my **Master 1 in Computer Science at Universit√© Lyon 1**.

The goal of these labs is to explore **supervised learning techniques** using Python and Scikit-learn ‚Äî from preprocessing and feature selection to model comparison and pipeline automation.
